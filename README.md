# vancouverTrails.search
A script that prompts users for input to then filter the search on any www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/* domain.

Made mostly for personal use (found it difficult to navigate their trails listing, but like the description of the hikes and usability of the site.

I will be working on a hiking aggregator/search soon, so not going to put much more time into this.

Contact me if you use this and would like it improved, or improve it yourself!
