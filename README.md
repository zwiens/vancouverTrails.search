# vancouvertrails.com/trails - filter the trails list

You'll need to install Tampermonkey (a browser extension). 

This script prompts users for input to then filter the search on any domain under www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/.

Made this mostly for personal use. I found it difficult to navigate their trails listing, but like the description of the hikes and usability of the site.

Works by asking you in little pop ups for filter details. Not perfect as some fields only ask for "min distance" for example, yet no "max distance".

Contact me if you use this and would like it improved, or improve it yourself!
